# MacQuarie-Excel
A showcase of the practice exercises I completed for the Excel Fundamentals for Data Analysis course on Coursera, run by Macquarie University. Each week had lessons and exercises to teach Excel functions, with further practice spreadsheets available at the end. This repository showcases what these practice spreadsheets looked like before and after finishing them, as well as highlighting what I learnt during that week.

Much of the content were things I already knew, but it was still particularly nice to refresh my knowledge on VLOOKUPS, XLOOKUPS, INDEX-MATCH and named ranges. I also learnt some new things, such as the differences between named referencing and structured referencing, as well as other little tricks when working with dates.
